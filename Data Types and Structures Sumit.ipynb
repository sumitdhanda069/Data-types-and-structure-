    " - Tuples is immutable so it is remain same after creation , can't be modified . Data integrity refers to the accuracy and consistency of data over its lifecycle. By using tuples, programmers can protect data from accidental changes. Since tuples do not allow modification, they are ideal for storing constant or fixed data that should not be altered during the execution of a program."

    " - Each key-value pair in a dictionary is stored based on the hash of the key. When we access a value using a key, Python internally computes the hash of the key to find the index where the value is stored."

    " - The primary reason strings are immutable in Python is because they are implemented as sequences of Unicode characters that are stored in memory as fixed, read-only data. When a string is created, Python allocates a fixed block of memory for it. Allowing in-place modifications would require copying or shifting data, which would make strings slower and more complex to manage.\n",

    " - Using in with Lists:\n",
    "When using in with a list, Python checks whether the specified value is present anywhere in the list.This requires Python to search sequentially through the list items until it finds a match or reaches the end.This operation has a linear time complexity, meaning the time to check increases with the size of the list.\n",
    " - Using in with Dictionaries: When using in with a dictionary, Python checks whether the specified key exists in the dictionary.Dictionaries are implemented as hash tables, so key lookup is very fast, typically constant time.Importantly, in checks only keys, not values, in dictionaries."

    "### 15. Can you modify the elements of a tuple ? Explain why or why not .\n",
    " - Tuples are immutable, which means that once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be changed, added, or removed. Therefore, you cannot modify the elements of a tuple.\n",

    " - In Python, a dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs implemented using a hash table .Accessing elements in a dictionary by key is generally very efficient, with an average-case time complexity of O(1) due to Python’s underlying hash table implementation. This efficiency makes dictionaries ideal for fast lookups and large-scale data management."

    " - dictionaries were considered unordered collections, which means they did not maintain the order in which items were added.\n",
    "Dictionaries were originally considered unordered because their internal structure was based on hashing, not the sequence of insertion. Although modern versions of Python preserve insertion order, dictionaries are still designed for fast key-based access, not position-based operations.This makes them powerful for lookups but less suited for tasks where the sequence of data is important.\n",
    " - Dictionaries use keys, not positions, to retrieve data.You cannot access items by index like in a list (my_dict[0] is invalid).The order of items doesn’t affect key-based access you still get the correct value for a given key.In Python versions before 3.7, the order of items when looping through a dictionary was not predictable."

    "A list stores items in a specific, ordered sequence. Data in a list is accessed using index numbers, which represent the position of an item. For example, my_list[2] retrieves the third item in the list. This makes lists ideal when the order of data matters, or when you need to perform operations based on item positions. it is slower\n",
    " - In contrast, a dictionary stores data as key-value pairs, and retrieval is done using keys instead of positions. For example, my_dict[\"name\"] retrieves the value associated with the key \"name\". This allows for faster and more direct access, especially when working with labeled data.\n",
